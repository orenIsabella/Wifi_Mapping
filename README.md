# Wifi_Mapping

This project allows the user to map all the wifi dots he has in a csv file. 
The user gives Wifi_Mapping a wiggle file that has information about thw wi-fi and the project creates a csv file with the strongest wi-fi signals of those the user gave him. 
After that, the user can decide weather he wants to filter the data. If he does, he can filter it by mac, by time and by location or by two of them combined.
The user can ask the project to create a KML file with the data.
The user can also add data from a SQL database.
